# SupermarketCSE333
This is our submission of the Database Systems course in Ain Shams University faculty of Computer Engineering and Software Systems(CESS) During the Spring 23/24 semester.

The project is about a supermarket management system where we're introduced to the core concepts of databases (ddl/dml) and putting them into action , it enriches our experience with data management and the interconnection between desktop application and database servers. Till now, most if not all of our projects' constant data were handled using reading/writing into text/binary files which was in efficient and unorganized. But in this project we use a very well designed schema to organize our data giving it a more structured shape, the project is in C++ with a GUI made using QT(QMake library).
